# AI Screenshot Assistant

An intelligent voice-based assistant that helps you understand content from screenshots using OCR and conversational AI.

## Features

- üì∏ **Screenshot Upload**: Upload one or multiple screenshots/images
- üîç **Smart OCR**: Automatic text extraction using Google Gemini AI (saves storage and processing time)
- üéôÔ∏è **Voice Conversations**: Talk naturally with the AI about your screenshots using ElevenLabs
- üí¨ **Context-Aware Q&A**: Ask questions like "What does this mean?" without needing to be specific
- üñºÔ∏è **Image Preview**: See your uploaded screenshots before creating the agent

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Create a `.env.local` file with your API keys:
```env
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_api_key_here
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

3. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## How to Use

1. **Upload Screenshots**: Click the upload area and select one or more screenshots
2. **Wait for OCR**: The app will automatically extract text from your images using Gemini
3. **Create Agent**: Click "Create Agent & Start Chat" to create your AI assistant
4. **Start Conversation**: Begin a voice conversation with the AI
5. **Ask Questions**: Simply say things like:
   - "What does this mean?"
   - "Explain this concept"
   - "Can you help me understand this?"

The AI understands contextual questions, so you don't need to be specific about what "this" refers to!
